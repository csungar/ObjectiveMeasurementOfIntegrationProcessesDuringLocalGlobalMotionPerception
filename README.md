## Objective Measurement of Integration Processes During Local-Global Motion Perception

This project was the initial code for a frequency tagging method to be used in a visuo-spatial experiment.
This code will later be connected to an fMRI to achieve frequency tagging, and predict visual imagery of observers.

Aim of this code was to create a visuo-spatial prompt of 8 dots moving in a circular pattern.
The code was written in an OO manner to be able to control the rotation frequencies of the dots. The dots could only display two viual outcomes:

1) 4 pair of dots fixated on the edges of a square, each of the pairs revolving on a different orbit.
2) When a synronization happens on the visual prompt we could observe these revolving dots as two intertwined squares rotating.

Abstract:
Many objects consist of different levels of visual features and humans control them by their attention set. Local information must be integrated into a global percept in order to perceive a scene. But these integration processes become more complicated for an ambiguous stimulus. In this experiment, we used dynamic ambiguous stimulus that consists of 4 rotating dot pairs. In this motion lattice (introduced by Kim & Anstis (2011),  two distinct object identities could be perceived: moving dots and moving objects. By using the ambiguous property of this motion lattice, we will examine the underlying neural correlations of local (moving dots)-global (moving abstract objects) motion perception. We aimed to trace the neural correlates of the participants' subjective experience with an objective measure, by applying the frequency-tagging technique to the ambiguous motion lattice.
